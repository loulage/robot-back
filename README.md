# Explore Mars! API to control a robot on Mars through HTTP protocol.

This is a small project to test my backend skills.
I also created a frontend webapp to interact with this API: 

Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Setup database settings inside `ormconfig.json` file
3. create a database on your favorite DB manager (I used PGadmin4)
4. Run `npm start` command
